# Let's Do This
An iPhone app by DoSomething.org, written in Objective C.

## Setup

#### API keys
First, you'll need to add a `keys.plist` into the "Lets Do This" directory. Add entries for the following keys (along with their relevant values):
* `northstarLiveKey`
* `northstarTestKey`
* `parseApplicationId`
* `parseClientKey`
* `fabricApiKey`
* `googleAnalyticsLiveTrackingID`
* `googleAnalyticsTestTrackingID`

#### Fonts
Next, add the required `Brandon_bld.otf` and `Brandon_med.otf` files into the "Lets Do This/Resources/Fonts" directory (which is untracked).
